- Benchmarked ChemXDyn against state-of-the-art trajectory analyzers (ChemTrYzer, ReacNetGenerator), demonstrating **higher accuracy** and a **significant reduction in spurious species and reactions**.

- Identified key reaction intermediates such as **N<sub>2</sub>H** and critical reactions, elucidated their role in NO<sub>x</sub> pathways.
