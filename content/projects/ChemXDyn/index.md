- Developed a **novel dynamics-based trajectory analysis framework** compatible with *ab initio*, reactive force fields (ReaxFF) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).

- Implemented time windowing for robust differentiation between persistent chemical bonds and transient collisional contacts.

- Designed **parallelized core modules** in Python for time-resolved interatomic distance analysis, enabling quantification of species lifetimes and occurrence frequencies.
