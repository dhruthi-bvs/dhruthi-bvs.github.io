- Performed detailed **bond order analysis** and dynamic analysis techniques such as **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), power spectrum (PS) analysis, and vibrational energy** profiling to distinguish bonded and non-bonded interactions.

- Used **ChemXDyn** to validate ReaxFF-based MD of hydrogen, multi-valent nitrogen chemistry in ammonia, and **neural-network molecular dynamics** (NNMD) simulations of methane combustion against experimental data.

- Proposed a **multiscale modeling** framework to investigate chemical kinetics at the molecular scale and validate the resulting mechanisms at the continuum scale through flame speeds and ignition delay times (IDT).

- These works culminated in my master's thesis, "A reactive molecular dynamics framework to obtain chemical kinetic models for fuel oxidation."
