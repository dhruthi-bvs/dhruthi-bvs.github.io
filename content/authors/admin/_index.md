<!-- My master’s research focused on molecular dynamics and multiscale modeling, where I co-developed \textbf{ChemXDyn}, a dynamics-based framework for accurately identifying species and reactions from MD trajectories (\textit{ab initio} methods, reactive force fields (ReaxFF), and machine-learned interatomic potentials). The extracted reaction mechanisms and rate constants were validated against experimental data and further assessed at the continuum scale through predictions of ignition delay times and flame speeds. My broader research interests include molecular dynamics, multiscale modeling, scientific computing, and machine learning. -->

Hi! I am Dhruthi, an inquisitive researcher working on molecular dynamics and multiscale modeling. I am keen on exploring new ideas, with molecular dynamics being my current interest. I have a deep passion for science and I truly believe in its potential to benefit society.

Beyond academics, I enjoy classical dance, poetry, and playing chess. I am a huge Potterhead who is immensely fascinated by beaches and ice creams.
